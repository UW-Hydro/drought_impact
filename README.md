## Purpose & Persepctive

The purpose of this document is not to summarize the already written proposal but to describe the current state of the project and my, (adi, the person writing this), thought process and goals.

A note on perspective: I am a graduated student at the UW studying Hydrology through Civil Engineering with influences from applied mathematics and gender studies. I am a white researcher belonging to a few non-majority communities and am working to document my though process throughout this project to hopefully increase the accessiblity of the project's technical details. Therefore, unless stated otherwise the opinions expressed in this repository are mine, influence by the world around me but not those submitted by group consensus.

## State of Project

Currently am examining drought indicators across the PNW in comparison to socio-economic metrics to look for relationships.

## Goals

- examine burn ban timing 
- incorporate statistics such as those expressed [here](https://www.drought.gov/documents/analysis-impact-drought-agriculture-local-economies-public-health-and-crime-across)
