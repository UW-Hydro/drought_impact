## Purpose & Persepctive

The purpose of this document is not to summarize the already written proposal but to describe the current state of the project and my, (adi, the person writing this), thought process and goals. Any concerns about the status of this project after checking if this document has been updated recently should be directed to my email: steinadi@uw.edu

A note on perspective: I am a graduated student at the UW studying Hydrology through Civil Engineering with influences from applied mathematics and gender studies. I am a white researcher belonging to a few non-majority communities and am working to document my though process throughout this project to hopefully increase the accessiblity of the project's technical details. Therefore, unless stated otherwise the opinions expressed in this repository are mine, influence by the world around me but not those submitted by group consensus. You can find out more about me by emailing me.

## Question

The United States Drought Monitor (USDM) is widely used to make policy declarations regarding drought disasters as a singular indicator meant to capture the severity of existing droughts and the potential for those droughts to evolve. Unlike other indicators, the USDM is compiled not by a direct formula but by a rotating team of experts that combine various drought indicator maps into a singular map. By comparing the timing and severity of the USDM to other drought indicators, we can understand what types of drought, (meteorological, snow, hydrologic, ecological), are captured by the USDM and where. With the USDM being used to largely inform political bodies about the state and existence of drought disasters, knowing what droughts need improved recognition from the USDM can increase awareness and support for communities impacted from lesser recognized forms of drought in the US.

## State of Project

4.25.2022

Finally getting around to updating these README's and changing from SEDI to nDrought (name pending ... it's the best thing I could find for now). The experiment outline and question above (which yes, I realize does not have a question mark) captures what this is about. So I'm going to skip that explanation.

Currently I'm focusing on comparing SPI to USDM, developing the workflows to do so, (including clipping an unruly amount of gridded USDM data), and so forth.
